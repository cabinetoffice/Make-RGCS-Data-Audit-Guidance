# Make-RGCS-Data-Audit-Guidance

This script generates the guidance to be distributed with the GCS Data Audit 2022. It requires a configuration file. This is the same configuration file used to configure the Data Portal. This script allows scope changes to the GCS Data Audit to be implemented quickly. It also constitutes a reproducible pipeline for generating documentation.
